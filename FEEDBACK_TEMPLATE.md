# Industry Expert Review: Trustworthy Experiments Core (tecore)

> **Note to Reviewer:** This feedback is part of a professional evaluation of the `tecore` framework's utility for the U.S. technology sector. Your insights on its methodology and business impact are greatly appreciated.

## 1. Expert Reviewer Identity (for Verification)
*This section helps establish the authority of the review for professional and legal documentation.*

- **Full Name:** - **Current Role:** (e.g., Lead Data Scientist, Head of Analytics)
- **Company / Organization:** (Must be a U.S.-based entity or international tech leader)
- **Professional Profile:** (Link to LinkedIn or GitHub)
- **Area of Expertise:** (e.g., A/B Testing, Causal Inference, Growth Engineering)

## 2. Methodology & Technical Rigor
- **Algorithm Validation:** How would you rate the implementation of Sequential Testing (mSPRT) and Ratio Linearization in this framework?
- **Methodological Soundness:** Does the framework address common "peeking problems" and variance issues effectively compared to standard industry practices?
- **CLI & Engineering:** How does the Command Line Interface (CLI) approach impact the speed of adoption and reproducibility within a professional data team?

## 3. Business Impact & Industry Relevance
- **Efficiency Gains:** In your opinion, how much R&D time or capital could a U.S. B2C company save by using this automated framework instead of building custom in-house tools?
- **Decision Quality:** How important is the "Trustworthy" aspect (CUPED, valid sequential boundaries) for preventing costly false-positive decisions in a high-stakes business environment?
- **National Interest:** Do you believe that making these advanced statistical tools accessible via open-source (CLI-ready) contributes to the overall competitiveness of the U.S. digital economy?

## 4. Practical Pilot Results (If tested)
- **Variance Reduction:** Did you observe a significant reduction in variance (CUPED) or experiment duration?
- **Usability:** How "production-ready" is the CLI tool for integration into existing data pipelines?

## 5. Expert Conclusion
- **Summary Statement:** (Example: "I find this framework to be a robust, industry-standard tool that solves critical experimentation challenges...")
- **Recommendation:** Would you recommend this framework for U.S.-based startups or enterprises looking to scale their experimentation culture?
